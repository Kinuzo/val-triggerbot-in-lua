Valorant triggerbot made in Lua

To use it you need to install [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and enable triggerbot.lua in scripts tab, you can bind it to side buttons like m4 or m5.

The cheat is currently undetectable and will probably continue like that since it doesn't interact directly with valorant memory.

Note: you need to add a valorant game capture before loading triggerbot.lua and use purple outline inside valorant settings.

If the cheat is not working try download old OBS version [27.1.3](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/27.1.3) and if it still not working try switching the dlls in your obs for the ones in obs_fix.
